            In this year alone, Nigerians – Christians and Muslims - have shared
            three religious rituals together. The word rituals is used
            sociologically, to mean – the expression of religious beliefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, Christians observed their annual festival of the Lenten
            season by fasting for a period of forty days culminating in the
            celebration of Jesus’ resurrection from the dead at Easter ( Feb.
            22nd-April 8th). The Muslims followed with the Ramadhan when they
            fasted for a period of thirty days culminating with the celebration
            of Eid ul-fitr ( festival of the breaking of the fast).
          </p>
          <p>
            During this last Ramadhan (20 July-18, August), for the first time
            in the history of Christian – Muslim relations in Nigeria, there
            were more joint iftah i.e. “breaking of fast” together than one
            recalls in recent past. This was a very good omen and a positive
            development in the relationship between these two communities in the
            northern parts of the country in particular. Unfortunately, the
            Christian community did not invite Muslim faithfuls with the same
            enthusiasm and frequency during the Lenten period!
          </p>
          <p>
            The second ritual is the very recent one that has just ended – eid
            adha – the "Festival of Sacrifice". For this ritual we will only
            make a few remarks and leave the details for a whole article. This
            festival is the celebration of the willingness of Abraham who sought
            the cooperation of his son, Ishmael ( not mentioned in the story) to
            offer him as a sacrifice to God. Having demonstrated his total
            obedience to God, God, replaced This son with a ram for that
            particular sacrifice ( As-Saffat, 37:100-111).It is this belief that
            eid adha reminds the Muslims of -the ritual of ram sacrifice.
          </p>
          <p>
            This same story is told in both the Jewish Bible and Christian Old
            Testament almost exactly with one major difference –the son is
            specifically named as Isaac- ( Gen. 22:1-18) in the Jewish and
            Christian Scripture. Whether we call him Abraham or Ibrahim – there
            is no theological significance as unfortunately, some ill-informed
            leaders of both communities would want us to believe. It is worth
            noting at this point that among the Iranians it is Isaac and not
            Ishma’il that was offered to God! Both communities emphasize the
            lesson of Abraham’s total obedience to God – for that, God blessed
            him in a very special way.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sacrifice in Islam has its relevance for the Christian
            Community in the feast of Easter when Christians observe the
            substitution of Isaac in the death of Jesus on the Cross. In
            Christian theological terms, Jesus is the perfect Lamb that takes
            away the sin of the whole world which resulted from the disobedience
            of Adam and Eve. Christians therefore, could see Eid Adha as the
            Islamic expression of the sacrificial death of Jesus on the Cross!
          </p>
          <p>
            In both faith traditions, the lesson is the same – obedience – total
            obedience to God! Abraham demonstrated his trust in God, Jesus
            Christ wholly surrendered Himself to die for the entire world so as
            to be reconciled back to God. Both faith traditions teach that only
            those who are truly obedient are followers of God – those who are
            truly submitted to Him are able to enjoy His blessings.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this eid celebration comes our third common ritual, the hajj –
            one of the Five Pillars of Islam – it is a command, a wajib in
            Arabic. As I write or you read this article, the Muslim pilgrims for
            this year are on their way back from this religious journey to
            Nigeria. As our Muslim Colleagues return, some Christians,
            particularly those who believe in Pilgrimage to Jerusalem are on
            their way to Jerusalem. For the Christian community, pilgrimage to
            Jerusalem is not commanded; it is not a religious injunction.
            Unfortunately, the fever of an annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem and
            some to Rome has caught up with a good number of Christians in
            Nigeria. Christians must now accept this reality that this ritual, a
            command to all Muslims has infested some Christian faithfuls who,
            though not a requirement for blessings from the Lord in the
            Christian faith, have begun to make this ritual almost an
            obligation.

            Lessons for both the Christian and Muslim Communities
          </h2>
          <p>
            Firstly, the sharp increase in sharing iftah together during the
            Ramadhan needs to be taken beyond just the thirty-day period. To
            prove to those who have interpreted this as a political agenda, and
            also scynical about having a constructive engagement with our Muslim
            faithfuls, we suggest that this initiative should now move to a
            higher level by studying our scriptures together and getting
            involved with each other in community development projects. The
            Anglican diocese of Kaduna is already engaged with the WAFF Road
            Mosque Forum in Kaduna along this line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, these growing relationships between our two communities
            need to be encouraged further by activities in solidarity. Boko
            Haram scourge should be an opportunity for joint actions against
            those who are committed to fanning the embers of hatred between
            Christians and Muslims, and the destruction of the northern sates.
            Our joint actions against this scourge will for confirm to the world
            that this is not what Islam teaches and preaches. Well-meaning
            leaders from both the Christian and Muslim communities must come
            together, make more Joint Statements condemning Violence on one hand
            and encouraging our young unemployed youths to get engaged in
            lucrative jobs and shun the attraction to violence.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>
              {' '}
              A third and final suggestion is a plea to all well-meaning
              Christians and Muslims to humble themselves and accept that there
              are no two or three Gods – there is only one God: Both the
              Christian and Muslim who know their scriptures agree that both the
              Holy Bible and the Glorious Qur'an affirm the following six
              claims.
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-3">
              <li>There is only one God, the one and only divine being.</li>
              <li>God created everything that is not God.</li>
              <li>
                God is radically different from everything that is not God.
              </li>
              <li>God is good.</li>
              <li>God commands that we love God with our whole being.</li>
              <li>God commands that we love our neighbours as ourselves.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
            As this writer continues to affirm, Christians and Muslims refer to
            the same God in their worship. This is a challenge to what I call
            holy living. It is how we live that tells others who our God is. The
            challenge before Christians and Muslims today in the northern states
            is to live what we believe. It is the way each Christian or Muslim
            behaves that informs the ‘other’ whether we worship the same God or
            not. The North has a significant number who profess to know this God
            – let such believers demonstrate their love for this God by living
            out their belief in Him. This is the only way we can save the lives
            of our young, intelligent men and women who in the future will help
            develop this part of the country as the southern parts.
